# Clipboard Landing Page

This is my solution to the Clipboard Landing Page challenge from Frontend Mentor, built as part of my journey to master Tailwind CSS. The project is a responsive, modern landing page for a fictional clipboard app, showcasing clean design, utility-first CSS, and responsive layouts.

## Overview

The Clipboard Landing Page is an HTML and CSS-only project (tailwind) designed to test UI and responsive design skills. It features a hero section, feature highlights, and a footer, with hover states and curved section borders for visual appeal. This implementation uses Tailwind CSS to achieve a pixel-perfect design based on the provided mockups.

## Features

- Responsive Design:
  Fully responsive layout using Tailwind’s sm:, md:, and lg: prefixes, ensuring compatibility across mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- Utility-First Styling:
  Leverages Tailwind CSS for rapid development with classes like bg-gradient-to-r, flex, and grid.
- Hover Effects:
  Interactive hover states for buttons and links, implemented with Tailwind’s hover: utilities.
